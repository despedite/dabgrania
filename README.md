# Dabgrania, the Perfect Imperfect Discord bot

An example bot I made on Discord.js + Javascript on a jiffy -- pretty basic, if I do say so myself. Includes a silly gif linked with embeds, a commands-command and a ping command did somebody say revolution.

#### OUTDATED

This is completely outdated and I'm keeping it here because legacy content. Mainly because I kind of got my server wrecked by accidentally sharing my token? It doesn't matter - I'd suggest you check out Tini <WIP> instead.

### Included commands:

**!commands** - Prints this, basically.
**!ping** - Outputs a pong. Also, a cute emoji!
**!dab** - Sends a dabbing embed coming your way.
